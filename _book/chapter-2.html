<p>Chapter 2 formalizes the concept of statistical learning by introducing the general statistical model used for modelling the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X = (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p)\)</span>, which can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:gsm">\[
Y = f(X) + \epsilon.
\tag{2.1}
\]</span></p>
<p>Here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> represents the response variable in our data set</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> represents the set of variables in our data set</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(X_p\)</span> represents the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>th variable in our data set</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(f(\dots)\)</span> represents a fixed but unknown function of its input(s)</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> represents a random error term which is independent of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and has mean zero</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of statistical learning is to estimate <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. There are two main reasons for estimating <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>: <em>prediction</em> and <em>inference</em>. Depending on whether our ultimate goal is prediction, inference, or some combination of the two, different methods for estimating <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> may be appropriate. In general, there is a trade-off between prediction accuracy and model interpretability. Models that make more accurate predictions tend to be less interpretable, and models that are more interpretable tend to make less accurate predictions (although this is not always the case, due to the potential for <em>overfitting</em> in highly flexible models).</p>
<p>The methods we use to estimate <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> can be characterized as either <em>parametric</em> or <em>non-parametric</em>. Parametric methods involve a two-step model-based approach: First we make an assumption about the functional form of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (e.g., we could assume <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is linear). Second we <em>fit</em> (train) the model to our training data in order to estimate the parameters. Non-parametric methods do not make any assumptions about the functional form of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Instead they try to find an estimate of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that gets close to the data points without being too rough or wiggly.</p>
<div id="prediction" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Prediction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prediction"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Because the error term <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> averages to zero, the general statistical model for predicting <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(X = (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p)\)</span> can be written as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:gsm-p">\[
\hat Y = \hat f(X).
\tag{2.2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\hat Y\)</span> represents the resulting prediction for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\hat f\)</span> represents our estimate for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When our goal is only to predict, we do not typically need to concern ourselves with the exact form of <span class="math inline">\(\hat f\)</span> provided that it accurately predicts <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. The accuracy of <span class="math inline">\(\hat Y\)</span> as a prediction for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> depends on two sources of error: <em>reducible error</em> and <em>irreducible error</em>. The error in our model attributable to <span class="math inline">\(\hat f\)</span> is <em>reducible</em> because we can potentially improve the accuracy of <span class="math inline">\(\hat f\)</span> for estimating <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> by using a more appropriate statistical learning technique. However, the error in our model attributable to <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is <em>irreducible</em> because <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is also a function of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is independent of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, so no matter how well we estimate <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, the variability associated with <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> will still be present in our model. This variability may come from unmeasured variables that are useful for predicting <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, or from unmeasurable variation. Irreducible error places an (often unknowable) upper bound on the accuracy of our prediction for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>

<p>When our goal is to understand the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X = (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p)\)</span>, we do need to concern ourselves with the exact form of <span class="math inline">\(\hat f\)</span>.

</h2>
<p>No one statistical learning approach performs better than all other approaches on all possible data sets. Because of this, care needs to be taken to choose which approach to use for any given data set to produce the best results. A number of important concepts arise when selecting a statistical learning approach for a specific data set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measuring the quality of fit</li>
<li>The bias-variance trade-off</li>
</ul>
<div id="in-the-regression-setting" class="section level3" number="2.3.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> In the Regression Setting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#in-the-regression-setting"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In the regression setting, the most commonly used quality of fit measure for training data is the mean squared error <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{MSE}\)</span>, given by</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:mse-training">\[
\mathit{MSE}_{\mathrm{training}} = \frac 1 n \sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \hat f(x_i))^2,
\tag{2.3}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\hat f(x_i)\)</span> represents the prediction that <span class="math inline">\(\hat f\)</span> gives for the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th observation. When predicted responses are very close to true responses the <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{MSE}\)</span> will be small; When predicted responses are very far from true responses the <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{MSE}\)</span> will be large. We generally do not really care about this value because accurately predicting data we have already seen is not particularly useful.</p>
<p>when our goal is to assess the accuracy of predictions when we apply our method to previously unseen <em>test data</em>, we can compute the mean squared error for test observations, given by</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:mse-testing">\[
\mathit{MSE}_{\mathrm{testing}} = \frac 1 n \sum_{i = 1}^n (y_0 - \hat f(x_0))^2,
\tag{2.4}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\((x_0, y_0)\)</span> is a previously unseen test observation not used to train the statistical learning model. We want to choose the model that gives the lowest <em>test</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{MSE}\)</span> by minimizing the distance between <span class="math inline">\(\hat f(x_0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_0\)</span>. When a test data set is available then we can simply evaluate Equation <a href="chapter-2.html#eq:mse-testing">(2.4)</a> and choose the statistical learning model where <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{MSE}\)</span> is the smallest. When a test data set is not available then we can use <em>cross-validation</em>, which is a method for estimating test <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{MSE}\)</span> using the training data set.</p>
<p>The expected test <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{MSE}\)</span> for a given value <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> can always be decomposed into the sum of three fundamental quantities: the <em>variance</em> of <span class="math inline">\(\hat f(x_0)\)</span>, the squared <em>bias</em> of <span class="math inline">\(\hat f(x_0)\)</span>, and the variance of the error term <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, written as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:expected-test-mse">\[
E \bigl(y_0 - \hat f(x_0) \bigr)^2 = \mathrm{Var}(\hat f(x_0)) +
                                     [\mathrm{Bias(\hat f(x_0))}]^2 +
                                     \mathrm{Var}(\epsilon),
\tag{2.5}
\]</span></p>
<p>where the notation <span class="math inline">\(E \bigl(y_0 - \hat f(x_0) \bigr)^2\)</span> defines the expected test <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{MSE}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>. The overall expected test <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{MSE}\)</span> is given by averaging <span class="math inline">\(E \bigl(y_0 - \hat f(x_0) \bigr)^2\)</span> over all possible values of <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> in the test data set.</p>
<p>The variance of <span class="math inline">\(\hat f\)</span> refers to the amount by which <span class="math inline">\(\hat f\)</span> would change if we estimated it using a different training set. The bias of <span class="math inline">\(\hat f\)</span> refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem with a much simpler model. In general, as models become more flexible, the variance will increase and the bias will decrease. The relative rate of change of the variance and bias determines whether the test <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{MSE}\)</span> increases or decreases. Because the variance and bias can change at different rates in different data sets, the challenge lies in finding a model for which both the variance and bias are lowest.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> In the Classification Setting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#in-the-classification-setting"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In the classification setting, the most commonly used quality of fit measure for training data is the <em>error rate</em>, given by</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:er-training">\[
\frac 1 n \sum_{i = 1}^n I(y_i \ne \hat y_i).
\tag{2.6}

<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(I(y_i \ne \hat y_i)\)</span> is an indicator variable that equals one if <span class="math inline">\(y_i \ne \hat y_i\)</span> (incorrectly classified) and zero if <span class="math inline">\(y_i = \hat y_i\)</span> (correctly classified)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>test error rate</em> for a set of test observations <span class="math inline">\((x_0, y_0)\)</span> is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:er-testing">\[
\frac 1 n \sum_{i = 1}^n I(y_0 \ne \hat y_0),
\tag{2.7}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\hat y_0\)</span> is the predicted class label that results from applying the classifier to the test observation with predictor <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The bias-variance trade-off is present in the classification setting too; when variance and bias are lowest then the test error rate will be at its smallest for a given data set.</p>

<p><span id="exr:unlabeled-div-1" class="exercise"><strong>Exercise 2.1  </strong></span>For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is extremely large, and the number of predictors <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is small.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Answer</em>. Better. A flexible model will generally be able to better estimate the the true <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and avoid overfitting when we have an extremely large sample size and a small number of predictors. The only exception would be if the true <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is linear, then an inflexible model would generally perform better; however, most real world relationships are not linear, so the lower bias of a flexible model will generally lead to a better quality of fit.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The number of predictors <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is extremely large, and the number of observations <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is small.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Answer</em>. Worse. A flexible model will generally lead to overfitting of our training data when the number of predictors is large and the sample size is small. An inflexible model is less likely to lead to overfitting in this scenario, so it will generally do a better job of giving accurate predictions on new observations than the flexible but overfit model.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Answer</em>. Better. A flexible model will generally be able to fit a highly non-linear relationship better than an inflexible model because the relative rate of decrease in bias tends to be much greater than the relative increase in variance when <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is highly non-linear. The left and right plots in Figure 2.12 on Page 36 of the book demonstrate this nicely.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The variance of the error terms, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2 = \mathrm{Var}(\epsilon)\)</span>, is extremely high.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Answer</em>. Worse. A flexible model will generally lead to overfitting of our training data when the variance of the error terms is extremely high. Because <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is partly a function of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, when the variance of the error terms is extremely high then the variance of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> will also be extremely high, mainly due to random error. A flexible model that tries to find patterns in this noise is more likely to pick up on patterns that are caused by random chance rather than true properties of the unknown function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. The bias of an inflexible model is preferable in this situation, as it will give more stable predictions in the long run, which is likely preferable to making the essentially random predictions a flexible model would give in these circumstances.</p>

<p><em>Answer</em>. The value of each measure in part (a) changes at different rates and in different directions as we go from less flexible statistical learning methods towards more flexible approaches. Broadly, this is why each curve has a different shape. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bias refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem with a much simpler model. In general, bias will decrease as models become more flexible, because more flexibility will lead to better approximations of a real-life problem, reducing error.</li>
<li>Variance refers to the amount by which <span class="math inline">\(\hat f\)</span> would change if we estimated it using a different training set. In general, variance will increase as models become more flexible, because a more flexible model will pick up patterns in the training data better which may differ between training sets.</li>
<li>Training error refers to the quality of fit of the model to the training data. In general, training error will steadily increase as models become more flexible, because more flexibility will allow the model to closely follow the training data.</li>
<li>Test error refers to the quality of fit of the trained model to the test data. In general, test error will be U-shaped because of the bias-variance trade-off.</li>
<li>Irreducible error refers to random error that is independent of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Because irreducible error is independent of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, it remains stable regardless of model flexibility.</li>

<p><em>Answer</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Predicting the temperature tomorrow where you live. The response would be temperature in degrees Celsius; the predictors would be average temperature where you live in the past seven days, the latitude, longitude, and altitude of where you live, and the month of the year. The goal would be prediction in order to decide what outfit you might wear tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding what aspects of a video game lead to people playing it longer. The response would be minutes spent playing a game; the predictors would be game genre, whether the game is an original or sequel, whether the game is singleplayer, multiplayer, or both, and the game developer. The goal would be inference to determine what makes a game engaging.</p></li>
<li><p>Predicting how long it would take for an injury to heal. The response would be time to heal; the predictors would be injury severity, age, and other indicators of physical health. The goal would be prediction in order to give patients an idea the time to recovery.</p></li>

<p><em>Answer</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identifying whether brain activity is more similar within or between individuals. The predictor variable would a repeated measure of functional connectivity. The goal would be inference in order to see whether brain activity recordings cluster together by individual.</p></li>
<li><p>Identifying whether patients with depression can be classified into subgroups. The predictor variables would be responses on a depression inventory. The goal would be inference in order to understand whether the depression inventory measures multiple types of depression.</p></li>

<p><span id="exr:unlabeled-div-5" class="exercise"><strong>Exercise 2.5  </strong></span>What are the advantages and disadvantages of a very flexible (versus a less flexible) approach for regression or classification? Under what circumstances might a more flexible approach be preferred to a less flexible approach? When might a less flexible approach be preferred?</p>
<p><em>Answer</em>. The advantage of a very flexible approach is less bias, so the model better approximates reality, and typically better prediction. The disadvantage is higher variance and the potential for overfitting. A more flexible model might be preferred if the goal of statistical learning is prediction. A less flexible approach might be preferred if the goal of statistical learning is inference, as simpler models tend to be easier to understand.</p>

<p><span id="exr:unlabeled-div-6" class="exercise"><strong>Exercise 2.6  </strong></span>Describe the differences between a parametric and a non-parametric statistical learning approach. What are the advantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification (as opposed to a non-parametric approach)? What are its disadvantages?</p>
<p><em>Answer</em>. Parametric methods involve a two-step model-based approach: First we make an assumption about the functional form of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (e.g., we could assume <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is linear). Second we <em>fit</em> (train) the model to our training data in order to estimate the parameters. The advantage of this is that it is easier to estimate a set of parameters than it is to fit an entirely arbitrary function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. The disadvantage is that the model we choose will usually not match the true unknown form of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, which can lead to poor estimates if we are too far from the true <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>
<p>Non-parametric methods do not make any assumptions about the functional form of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Instead they try to find an estimate of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that gets close to the data points without being too rough or wiggly. The advantage of this is that it becomes easier to accurately fit a wider range of possible shapes for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. However, the disadvantage of this is that doing so accurately requires a much larger number of observations since the problem of estimating <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to a small number of parameters.</p>

<p>Suppose we wish to use this data set to make a prediction for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(X1 = X2 = X3 = 0\)</span> using K-nearest neighbours.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Compute the Euclidean distance between each observation and the test point, <span class="math inline">\(X1 = X2 = X3 = 0\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Answer</em>.</p>
<p>The equation for Euclidean distance is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:euclidean-distance">\[
d(p, q) = \sqrt{ \sum_{i = 1}^n (q_i - p_i)^2},
\tag{2.8}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(d(p, q)\)</span> represents the distance between points <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> dimensional Euclidean space, and <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> represent Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> dimensional Euclidean space.</p>
<p>This can be computed in R like so.</p>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What is our prediction with <span class="math inline">\(K = 1\)</span>? Why?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Answer</em>. When <span class="math inline">\(K = 1\)</span> our prediction for the test point will be whatever training observation is closest to the test point. Observation 5 (Green) is closest so our prediction is that the test point is Green.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What is our prediction with <span class="math inline">\(K = 3\)</span>? Why?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Answer</em>. When <span class="math inline">\(K = 3\)</span> our prediction for the test point is given by the class with highest estimated probability based on the three points in the training data that are closest to the test point. Here observations 5 (Green), 6 (Red), and 2 (Red) are closest, which results in probabilities of 1/3 for the Green class and 2/3 for the Red class. So our prediction is that the test point is Red.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>If the Bayes decision boundary in this problem is highly non-linear, then would we expect the best value for <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> to be large or small? Why?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Answer</em>. We would expect a smaller value of K to give the best predictions. But not too small. When <span class="math inline">\(K = 1\)</span> the KNN decision boundary will be overly flexible, while with a large value of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> it will not be sufficiently flexible.</p>
