KNN regression, hand, simply uses response value \\(y_i\\) , since ’s continuous value. also summed get numerator fraction (\\(K\\) denominator), although makes sense think average training observations \\(\\mathcal N_0\\).left hand side equation, KNN classifier estimate conditional probability test observation \\(x_0\\) belongs class \\(j\\). can use probability assign \\(x_0\\) class \\(j\\) highest probability, choose (although don’t , probabilities equally useful).

However, true relationship slightly nonlinear ’s hard say lower training RSS, . likely situations one better ; although general cubic regression might overfit thus lower RSS.Answer (c) using test rather training RSS.Answer., ’s hard say sure. true relationship \\(X\\) \\(Y\\) slightly nonlinear, might expect cubic regression overfit training data, bias linear regression may lead better predictions (lower RSS) test data. true relationship cubic cubic regression lower test RSS since match true form \\(f(X)\\). true relationship far linear expect cubic regression lower RSS since better bias-variance trade linear regression.Exercise 3.5  Consider fitted values result performing linear regression without intercept. setting, \\(\\)th fitted value takes form\\[\n\\hat y_i = \\hat \\beta x_i,\n\\]\\[\n\\hat \\beta = \\bigg(\\sum_{= 1}^n x_i y_i \\bigg) / \\bigg(\\sum_{' = 1}^n x_{'}^2 \\bigg).\n\\]Show can write\\[\n\\hat y_i = \\sum_{' = 1}^n a_{'} y_{'}.\n\\]\\(a_{'}\\)?Answer.can get solution :Plugging expression \\(\\hat \\beta\\) formula \\(\\)th fitted value.Moving constant \\(x_i\\) numerator summation expression changing numerator summation dummy variable \\('\\), since \\(x_i\\) independent \\('\\).Moving summation \\('\\) numerator.Moving \\(y_{'}\\) numerator.looks like\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat y_i &= x_i \\hat \\beta \\\\\n         &= x_i \\frac{\\sum_{= 1}^n x_i y_i}{\\sum_{' = 1}^n x_{'}^2} \\\\\n         &= \\frac{\\sum_{' = 1}^n x_i x_{'} y_{'}}{\\sum_{'' = 1}^n x_{''}^2} \\\\\n         &= \\sum_{' = 1}^n \\frac{x_i x_{'} y_{'}}{\\sum_{'' = 1}^n x_{''}^2} \\\\\n         &= \\sum_{' = 1}^n \\frac{x_i x_{'}}{\\sum_{'' = 1}^n x_{''}^2} y_{'} \\\\\n         &= \\sum_{' = 1}^n a_{'} y_{'},\n\\end{align}\n\\]\\[\na_{'} = \\frac{x_i x_{'}}{\\sum_{'' = 1}^n x_{''}^2}.\n\\]Note: interpret result saying fitted values linear regression linear combinations response values.Exercise 3.6  Using least squares coefficient estimates equation, argue case simple linear regression, least squares line always passes point \\((\\bar x, \\bar y)\\).Answer.least squares coefficient estimates given \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat \\beta_1 &= \\frac{\\sum_{= 1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)(y_i - \\bar y)}\n                     {\\sum_{= 1}^n (x_i - \\bar x)^2}, \\\\\n\\hat \\beta_0 &= \\bar y - \\hat \\beta_1 \\bar x.\n\\end{align}\n\\]least squares line given \\[\n\\hat y = \\hat \\beta_0 + \\hat \\beta_1 x.\n\\]\\(x = \\bar x\\) \\(\\hat y = \\bar y\\) least squares line. can demonstrated substituting least squares coefficient estimate equation intercept least squares line equation,\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat y &= \\hat \\beta_0 + \\hat \\beta_1 \\bar x \\\\\n       &= \\bar y - \\hat \\beta_1 \\bar x + \\hat \\beta_1 \\bar x \\\\\n       &= \\bar y.\n\\end{align}\n\\]Since least squares line passes values \\(X\\), always pass mean predictor \\(\\bar x\\), exists somewhere smallest largest values \\(x\\). shown , \\(x = \\bar x\\) \\(\\hat y = \\bar y\\) least squares line, thus least squares line always passes point \\((\\bar x, \\bar y)\\).Exercise 3.7  claimed text case simple linear regression \\(Y\\) onto \\(X\\), \\(R^2\\) statistic equal square correlation \\(X\\) \\(Y\\).
