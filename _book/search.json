KNN regression, hand, simply uses response value \\(y_i\\) , since â€™s continuous value. also summed get numerator fraction (\\(K\\) denominator), although makes sense think average training observations \\(\\mathcal N_0\\).left hand side equation, KNN classifier estimate conditional probability test observation \\(x_0\\) belongs class \\(j\\). can use probability assign \\(x_0\\) class \\(j\\) highest probability, choose (although donâ€™t , probabilities equally useful).
