# Classification {#chapter-4}

Chapter 4 covers several methods that can be used for classification, including:

- Binomial and multinomial logistic regression
- Linear and quadratic discriminant analysis
- Naive Bayes
- KNN classifier

It's worth noting that although the emphasis was on classification, some of these are class probability models; thus, their use for classification based on thresholds goes beyond the model and may not be necessary in practice.

The chapter also introduces generalized linear models more broadly, with particular attention to poisson regression.
